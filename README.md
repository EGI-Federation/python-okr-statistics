# python-okr-statistics

This repository contains python clients to produce statistics that can be
used by EGI Foundation team to identify trends and monitor progress following
the Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) goal-setting framework.
Specifically, the statistics generated by these python clients are:

- **Cloud CPU/h** consumed by the production VOs of EGI
- **HTC CPU/h** consumed by the production VOs of EGI
- Num. of **'active'**, **'total'** and **'actual'** users of the production
  VOs registered in the [EGI Operations Portal](https://operations-portal.egi.eu/)
- Num. of Service Orders (SOs) received from the [EOSC MarketPlace](https://marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/)
- ...

The statistics generated by these python clients will be pushed in a Google Worksheet
using the [gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/v5.10.0/) APIs
